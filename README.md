# ðŸ‘» Ghost in the Graveyard simulation

A simple multi-agent simulation of an outdoor game for children, named "*Ghost in the Graveyard*".
Inspired by the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent modelling approach.

## Description

The simulation follows the following rules of the game, with some minor adjustments:

All agents are placed randomly in the grid world. The **Ghosts** and **Players** "wander" around. If a Player finds a Ghost, it stops and notifies all other Players that a Ghost has been found. Any player that finds a Ghost is considered to be "safe". All Players except the one that found the Ghost run to the **Exit**. The found Ghost starts moving towards the closest Player other than the one that found it in an attempt to "catch" it. If the Ghost catches a Player, the latter becomes a Ghost that starts wandering. All players that arrive at the Exit cell disappear from the grid.
